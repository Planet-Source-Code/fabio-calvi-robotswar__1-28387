Having noticed the high potential of the Digital Dragon "Rpg Basic" program
I decided to join it with the Carlos "D 2D Map Engine" source code and
create this one program, to study the problems about an arcade / strategy game.

My first idea was to create a game like Warcraft,Command and Conquer or   
Total Annihilation, with upgradeable buildings and structures such as robot
factory, energy plants, depots, labs, defensive weapons, etc., but the pictures
became too many and too big in bytes to upload them.  

So, I changed the original structure of the source code to upload a 
playable game: it became a sort of battle in an "arena".

But now, I have decided to drop it to devote myself to the my first idea with 
an isometric version and to upload this top-down perspective version to you.  

Therefore it's unfinished (so you could find some little bugs and quirks in it)
and not well performed, but it's full playable.

However I think it's a good starting point to realize an arcade/rpg/strategy
game, if you like this kind of games. 
In it, you can find: moving and rotating characters, basic enemy AI, single
and group selection, gunner-bullet-target collimation, etc.

Try to finish it; there is a lot of work to do, again.

I hope someone can learn from this program.

Everybody can modify the code or employ parts of it within own projects (just
a little credit, please);
only one restriction: NOBODY MUST USE ANY PART OF THIS PROGRAM IN COMMERCIAL
PURPOSES.

Send the game to friends, and have fun with it.
Feel encouraged to spread the program around the net.  

I would appreciate it if you give me feedback.

Every comments, suggestions, ideas and e-mails are always welcomed to:

Happy coding and have fun! 

Goodbye, Fabio.
